                        Who wants to own real estate in the big city? Silver Stonks will launch a secondary NFT collection with unique buildings around the city. In Silverback City you can finally own an entire building in the most popular streets. Buy blocks of the city to have advertising rights on your building and earn passive income.
                        <br />
                        If you own the NFT, you will own the exploitation rights over your building. Silver Stonks encourages you to diversify your portfolio between digital and hard assets. Being paid for advertising rights will just be the beginning, as we develop our Play 2 Earn games that let you esrn real assets and stores of value. Get your building in Silverback City and start taking advantage of the NFT world.
